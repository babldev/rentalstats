# Rental Stats

An python app for crawling craigslist and graphing stats on the apartment rental market.

It's currently configured for San Francisco, but it could be easily reconfigured for other cities. The app works by crawling craigslist hourly, parsing listings by neighborhood, and storing them in the database. Historical trends are displayed using the Google chart API.

Currently configured to run on Heroku.

## Configuring your test environment

- Get the Heroku toolbelt and set up a virtualenv using [these steps](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/python).
- Create a .env file in the root directory to add custom run options. Optional flags include:
    - `DEBUG=1` Run Flask in debug mode.
- Start the server using `foreman start`
